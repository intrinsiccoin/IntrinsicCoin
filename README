Setting up your environment: 

On Linux:
        Dependencies: GCC 4.7.3 or later, CMake 2.8.6 or later, and Boost 1.58.
        You may download them from:
        http://gcc.gnu.org/
        http://www.cmake.org/
        http://www.boost.org/

        Execute the following command to get everything you need in order to setup an environment in the command prompt 
        $ sudo apt-get install build-essential git cmake libboost1.58-all-dev

On Windows:
        Dependencies: MSVC 2013 or later, CMake 2.8.or later, and Boost 1.57. You may download them from:
        http://www.microsoft.com/
        http://www.cmake.org/
        http://www.boost.org/

        A very helpful step-by-step windows environment setup guide is provided here. 

        I have successfully built my coin using MSVC  2017, Boost 1.66 x64, CMake v3.11.0

Building Executables:

On Ubuntu Linux: 

1. Clone this repository
	Execute the following command to copy this repository on your computer
	$ git https://github.com/intrinsiccoin/intrinsiccoin.git

3. Open the folder with copied repository and execute cmake
	Execute the following command to get into the directory with copied repository
	$ cd intrinsiccoin
       $ mkdir build
       $ cd build
       $ cmake ..


4. Build the executables
	Execute the following command to build a coin
	$ make 

        Advanced options:
        Parallel build: run `make -j<number of threads>' instead of `make' depending on the number of cores you would like to use to speeden up the process . Ex. make -j4
	The resulting executables can be found in Build\src\Release.
	Advanced options:
                Parallel build: run `make -j<number of threads>' instead of `make'.
                Debug build: run `make build-debug'.
                Test suite: run `make test-release' to run tests in addition to building. Running `make test-debug' will do the same to the debug version.
                Building with Clang: it may be possible to use Clang instead of GCC, but this may not work everywhere. To build, run `export CC=clang CXX=clang++' before running `make'.

        You should see the following files created 



On Windows: 

1. Clone this repository
        Execute the following command to copy this repository on your computer using Git Bash or regular windows command prompt
	$ git https://github.com/intrinsiccoin/intrinsiccoin.git
2. Use CMake to create your MSVC 2017 Project. 
        To build, change to a directory where this file is located, and run this commands: 
        $ mkdir build
        $ cd build
        $ cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 Win64" ..

        Alternately, you could use Cmake GUI

        a. Browse the source folder and select build folder.
        b. Step 1, click 'Configure', change options if you like, below in the image, I modified CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES to only select 'Release'.
        c. Step 2, click 'Generate' to create intrinsiccoin.sln project in the 'Build' folder.

2. Build your executables in  MSVC 2017 Project. 

        d. Step 3, click 'Open Project' and once the project is loaded click 'Build Solution' in the 'Build' menu. 

        Your four executables should be created in \Build\src\Release folder. ie intrinsiccoind.exe, miner.exe, simplewallet.exe and walletd.exe.

        You can first launch the intrinsccoind.exe daemon and then the simplewallet.exe CLI wallet

Good luck!
